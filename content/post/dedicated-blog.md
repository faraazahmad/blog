For a while now, I've been mulling over whether to set up my own dedicated blog.

I've blogging on and off for a few years now and while its been an amazing experience, the posts have never all been in a single 
dedicated place. I started off with blogging on Medium just because it was the most popular thing at the time, and that defintely 
helped me gain a good amount of audience (especially for a silly undergrad who probably had nothing interesting to share). 

I then made the inevitable switch to DEV as a lot of my articles were starting to contain code examples, Medium just didn't support
code highlighting and using Git gists felt a bit clunky. Back then, I did think about switching over to my own dedicated blog using 
Jekyll but a mix of laziness and the sheer amount of benefits that come from network effects swayed me into solely using DEV 
for a while.

## The power of network effects

What was so great about the network effects? Well, in the initial days of DEV I'd seen a lot of the popular devs hop onto it make a lot
of high quality posts. Then the official DEV account would tweet a link to their posts. At the time I barely had any following so I saw it
as a good opportunity to quickly increase my reach. 

Gain more followers I did, but I definitely had to write some quality articles for it (atleast I tried to). Which I think a lot of posts
these days don't try to, but thats a topic for another day. All in all, these network effects helped me increase my Twitter following by
three fold. 

## Connecting with like minded people

Now I'm not someone who's simply looking to increase their follower count by any means, but being retweeted by an account followed by 
tens of thousands of developers, I was able to connect and discover a lot of important people in the industry -- namely startup founders,
CEOs and a lot of software developers -- that I respect. I believe this really improved the quality of my Twitter feed as I have a lot of 
quality content on it now as opposed to the generic everyday Twitter feuds (although I still enjoy those from time to time).

## Why switch now?

So if its all so great, why switch? Surely if there's so many benefits to being part of a network I should be doubling down on it and 
streamlining my blogging processes? Yes that's right I should be.

But the simple answer is that **I'm just not super interested in doing that anymore**. There's a few reasons for it:

### Don't need to rely on network effects

By no means do I have a massive Twitter following but it's decent enough for me that I don't need to solely rely on the network effects to 
have a sizeable reach. Bare in mind that I'm not suggesting anyone with a decent following should go off such networks and I 
defintely wouldn't be going off DEV completely.

### DEV has gone downhill in quality (a bit)

I'll tell you about my experience with Quora from a while ago. Initially it used to be this really thoughtfull, intriguing place with people asking great 
questions giving great answers. But as the hype grew, more people joined and it became kind of a pseudo-intellectual place (I think). 
An answer where a one-liner would've been more than adequate, it goes on for a whole page just as a way to come across as more "intellectual".
I have been off Quora for a while so I'm not aware of the site's content quality now, maybe it did improve but my excitement for it has waned off.

Now I might be biased and maybe even ill-informed but I've been seeing similar patterns with DEV as well. Thankfully not with the pseudo-intellectualism 
(is that a word?) as I believe people are still writing some good articles and their content moderation team has been doing a stellar job in removing spam.
I could probably write a whole post about why I lost interest with DEV but I think thats out of the scope for this post, and no one's really at fault here
as I believe this is a side effect of a social network increasing in size, but I digress.

I have to add that DEV aren't doing *nothing* about this, they are actively [trying to fight spam](https://dev.to/devteam/help-fight-spam-in-our-community-1ngb)
and bringing the posts quality back up, which is why I wont be totally going off DEV.

### Monkey see, monkey do

I feel like I have been a bit too harsh towards DEV and so I have to be a bit harsh towards my decision making too. I mentioned that the network
effects introduced me to a lot of developers I respect and a good majority of them just maintain ther own blogs and maybe occasionally post on 
platforms like DEV. So in a way I'm literally just doing what they've done and hoping it'll all work out.

*Lets see how it all works out. Que sera sera*
