For a while now, I've been mulling over whether to set up my own dedicated blog.

I've blogging on and off for a few years now and while its been an amazing experience, its never all been in a single dedicated place.
I started off with blogging on Medium just because it was the most popular thing at the time, and that defintely helped me get a good 
amount of audience (especially for a silly undergrad who probably had nothing interesting to share). 

I then made the inevitable switch to DEV, as a lot of my articles were starting to contain code examples and Medium just didn't support
code highlighting. Back then, I did think about switching over to my own dedicated blog using Jekyll, but a mix of laziness and just the 
sheer amount of benefits that come from network effects swayed me into solely using DEV for a while.

## The power of network effects

What was so great about the network effects? Well, in the initial days of DEV I'd seen a lot of the popular devs hop onto it make a lot
well recevied posts. Then the official DEV account would tweet a link to their posts. At the time I barely had any following so I saw it
as a good shortcut to gain more followers. 

Gain more followers I did, but I definitely had to write some quality articles for it. Which I think a lot of posts these days don't try
to, but thats a topic for another day. All in all, these network effects helped me increase my Twitter folling by three fold. 

## Connecting with like minded people

Now I'm not someone who's simply looking to increase their follower count, but being retweeted by an account followed by tens of thousands
of developers I was able to connect with a lot of startup founders, CEOs and a lot of software developers that I respect. I believe this 
really improved the quality of my Twitter feed as I have a lot of quality content on it as opposed to your generic everyday Twitter feuds.

## Why switch now?

So if its all so great, why switch? Surely if there's so many benefits to being part of a network I should be doubling down on it and 
streamlining my blogging processes? Yes that's right I should be.

But the simple answer is that I'm just not super interested in doing that anymore. There's a few reasons for it:

### Don't need to rely on network effects

By no means do I have a masiive Twitter following but it's decent enough for me that I don't need to soley rely on the network effects to 
have a sizeable reach. Bare in mind that I'm not suggesting that anyone with a decent following should comne off such networks and I 
defintely wouldn't be going off DEV completely.

### DEV has gone downhill in quality (a bit)

I'll tell you about my experiencewith Quora. Initially it used to be this really thoughtfull, intriguing place with people asking great 
questions and people giving great answers. But as the hype grew, more people joined and it became kind of a pseudo-intellectual place. 
An answer where a one-liner would've been more than adequete, it goes on for a whole page just as a way to come across as more 'intellectual".
I have been off Quora for a while so I'm not aware of the site's content quality now, maybe it did improve but my excitement for it has waned off.

Now I might be biased and maybe even ill-informed but I've been seeing similar patterns with DEV as well. Thankfully not with the pseudo-intellectualism 
(is that a word?) as I believe their content moderation team has been doing a stellar job in removing articles that dont seem to be contributing any value,
but the quality and type of posts has not been what it used to be in its initial days, at least its not what got me hooked initially. This has made me lose 
interest in DEV, that I barely visit the site anymore as opposed to before when I regularly visited it in my free time and always found something interesting
to read.

Now I have to add that DEV aren't doing nothing about this, they are actively [trying to fight spam](https://dev.to/devteam/help-fight-spam-in-our-community-1ngb)
and bringing the posts quality back up which is why I wont be totally going off DEV.

### Monkey see, monkey do

I feel like I have been a bit too harsh towards DEV and so I have to be a bit harsh towards my decision making too. I mentioned that the network
effects introduced me to a lot of developers I respect and a good majority of them just maintain ther own blogs and maybe occasionally post on 
platforms like DEV. So in a way I'm literally just doing what they've done and hoping it'll all work out.

*Lets see how it all works out. Que sera sera*
