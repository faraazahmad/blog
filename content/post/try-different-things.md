I've been wanting to write this blog post for a few years, but I've never had the right kind of experience to justify 
it. You see, over the past couple of years I have been trying to explore areas in software development that 
fascinate me.

I've tried my hands at a couple of things:

1. Game development
2. Web development
3. Tried to build an OS kernel
4. Built a programming language
5. Worked at a massive org.
6. Worked at a couple early-stage startups.
7. Tried all the text editors

### Game development

Like most people I know in tech, video games are what got them into computers. Somewhere along the way, I beleive 
every developer tries their hand at making a game. Maybe it was nostalgia, fun or the chance to recreate something
like my favourite games, I knew I wanted to try building a game. 

I searched for popular game engines, tried their tutorials, and started making games that were similar to the ones I
enjoyed.

Rookie mistake.

While developing a game you need to write code, write a story, implement character animations, interactions,
inventory, music, sound effects, A/B test your game, market your game...

and it is, everything.

Your first game should probably be tic-tac-toe, or pacman or something similar. It should be extremely simple to
implement, and a safe space for you to learn your game dev environment.

You only make your life worse by starting out with a game that has a massive scope. There's a reason that even massive
game studios with all the budget and expertise require their employees to undergo "crunch periods". Most people start
out learning game-dev with these massive ideas they have for games, and they burn out trying to learn and build 
everything.

I did it too, guess what happened next.

Oh well, maybe it wasn't for me.

### Web development - focused individually on frontend, backend. Just settled for full-stack. (Rails ftw)

Look, I've been fooling around with HTML/CSS since I was 9. 

I was there when the HTML5 and CSS3 launch was the big thing.

I remember vividly that I had once stayed home from school because of a fever. When I felt slightly better, I 
hopped onto https://w3schools.com to do a JavaScript quiz.

I was obssessed with different website templates, all of their unique designs with CSS and their interativity using jQuery, It was the best thing ever. 

This is probably also why I am usually confused when people say CSS is hard. You can code Djikstra's graph search algorithm but you don't know how CSS cascades? Get good.

Anyways, at the end of high school, I wanted to take my knowledge further in this area. I knew JS so I quickly got convonced by the _cult_ of thinking that you should have one language run everywhere. Nodejs had been out for a little while, so 
there were libraries & frameworks like Express, Angular, Ember, etc. But all of it came with tons of manual configuration, and I was repulsed.

Then I found out about **Ruby on Rails**, and **it was exactly what I needed**.

* Tried to build an operating system.
* I tried to build my own programming language.
* Worked in a massive-size org, worked in a couple early stage startups.
* Worked as a contractor, got familiar with such an environment.
* I've attempted to start my own business, none of them took off. The last one had promise but I just didn't feel it
was the right niche for me to work in.
* I tried different IDEs and text editors. Eclipse, intelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio, SublimeText, VSCode, Emacs, Vim,
Helix, Zed.
* Talk about the book Range by David Epstein. Give Tiger Woods example, then Roger Federer example.
* By no means am I an expert in everything, but you don't need to be. You just need to acquire the worldview of that 
community.


you're gonna make it.
